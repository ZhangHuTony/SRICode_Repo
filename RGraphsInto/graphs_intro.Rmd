```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading data

This package is required to be able to read the data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
data <-read.csv("/Users/montana/Desktop/melanoma/code/first experiment 104/104lineage.csv")
```




if you want to view part of the data use the head function
```{r}
head(data)
```

if you want to remove some columns use the line below
```{r}
data <- data[ -c(6:10,19,21) ]
head(data)
```


# some basic plots

You can use the plot function which you say the data set you are using and then the columns you want to look at separated by a dollar sign
```{r}
plot(data$Dry_Mass,data$Volume)
```


Another way you can create graphs is to use ggplot

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Dry_Mass, y = Volume)) + 
  geom_point() 
```
