# SRI Code
This repository holds all the code that was compiled while doing research under the Adler Mathematical Biology Lab at the University of Utah, while collaborating with members of the Judson-Torres lab.

- `Filter Cell Data/` - contains RMD files attempting to identify bad cell tracks on a rules-based approach.
- `UsefulPackages/` - an R package that I wrote to do some simple data preprocessing.
- `crowding_proj/` - Project whose goal was to see if there was any relationship between the BRN-2 protein expression between neighbors.
- `data/` - data provided by experiments ran at the Judson-Torres Lab at the Huntsman Cancer Institute.
